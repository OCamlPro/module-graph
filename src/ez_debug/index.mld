{1 Library ez_debug}

The ocp-cmtdeps tool generates a graph of dependencies between OCaml modules using compiled object files. ocp-cmtdeps scans the current directory and sub-directories looking for .cmt/.cmti/.cmi files, creates a memory graph of dependencies between them, and uses `dot` to display the graph into a pdf/image file.



The entry point of this library is the module: {!Ez_debug}.
